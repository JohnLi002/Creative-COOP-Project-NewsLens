# NewsLens

The overall purpose of NewsLens is to help highlight the bias present in articles. Currently this repository only contains files related to a machine learning algorithms with the purpose of predicting the news outlet based on the text given to it as well as various other files with the purpose of bringing our project to life. We are far from done however we hope that in the future we can complete it.

There are several csv files we used but are not present within this github. I you want to use the datasets we used, everything originates from the "All the News" in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news). You can use our Categorize_Datasets.py and Create_Test_Dataset.py files withiin the Datasets folder to help create csv files that were used.

## Libraries were installed
If you are having trouble with using any of these libraries despite installing the necessary them, please try to use anaconda and create an environment that solely for the specific packages needed. That is what I had done to run some of these files.

### Libraries used to create Neural Network
[Sci-Kit Learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)

[TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/)

[Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras)
-Although you can use tensorflow to get to Keras, there is also the option of installing it directly [here](https://pypi.org/project/keras/)

*Below are libraries that were used to create heatmaps so we could visually see of results*

[Seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) *Seaborn also required the 3 libaries below*
